# redux.android
Android native app state management using Redux.

## Why?
A unidirectional flow of state automatically reduces (no pun intended) bugs in code and makes it easily understandable.

With Redux, management of business logic is segregated from presentation, unlike **MVVM.**

A **ViewModel** can still be used alongside Redux (which is the direction this repo will be headed).
