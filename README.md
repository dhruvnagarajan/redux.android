# redux.android
A global pub/sub Store which is an extension of `android.arch.lifecycle.ViewModel`.

## Usage

Initialize in application scope.
``` kotlin
class App : Application() {
  
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        /*
         * optional initial state
         */
        val initialState = TreeMap<String, Any?>()
        initialState["count"] = 0

        ReduxStore.Builder()
            .withInitialState(initialState)
            .isDebug(BuildConfig.DEBUG)
            .build()
    }
}
```

Extend `ReduxViewModel`, to listen to `ReduxStore` directly.
``` kotlin
/**
 * ReduxViewModel : android.arch.lifecycle.ViewModel
 */
class MyViewModel : ReduxViewModel() {

    val countLiveData = MutableLiveData<Int>()

    /**
     * @return tag of implementing class
     */
    override fun getStoreTag(): String = MyViewModel::class.java.name

    /**
     * Consume redux output.
     * @param action contains the dispatched event details.
     * @param appState contains global state of the app.
     */
    override fun onStateChange(action: Action, appState: TreeMap<String, Any?>) {
        if (action.isIncognito)
            // Via dispatchIncognitoAction()
            // Store doesn't know about this action
            ...
        else
            // Via dispatchAction()
            // Store saves this action's payload
            ...
    }

    /**
     * Optional override.
     * If no Reducer is provided, [ReduxStore] will consume raw payload.
     * @return reducers: list of reducers. Reducers are run in serial.
     */
    override fun addReducers(): List<Reducer> {
        return listOf(CountReducerImpl)
    }

    // Called from view
    fun increment() {
        // Save action's payload in Store
        dispatchAction(Action("inc", 1))

        // Or,

        // Don't store action's payload in Store
        // Live observers will receive this action directly,
        // after passing through optional reducers
        dispatchIncognitoAction(Action("count", count))
    }

    // Called from view
    fun decrement() {
        dispatchAction(Action("dec", 1))
    }
}
```

Implement optional reducer. Add to `ReduxStore` using `addReducers()` in `ReduxViewModel`.
``` kotlin
/**
 * Optional implementation of Reducer.
 * Passed to Redux via [ReduxViewModel.addReducers].
 * 
 * If ReduxViewModel is not used, then reducer(s) could be passed to
 * [ReduxStore.subscribeWithReducer(s)] during subscription.
 * 
 * Reducers will be removed upon unsubscription.
 * ReduxViewModel handles subscription implicitly.
 */
object CountReducerImpl : Reducer {

    /**
     * @return reduced payload
     *
     * [Action.payload] sent via dispatch(). This payload can be consumed as is, or reduced.
     */
    override fun reduce(action: Action, appState: TreeMap<String, Any?>) {
        when (action.actionType) {
            "inc" -> {
                appState["count"] = appState["count"] as Int + action.payload as Int
            }
            "dec" -> {
                appState["count"] = appState["count"] as Int - action.payload as Int
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Design philosophies behind **redux.android**

This library is simply more than vanilla redux.

- `ReduxStore` could be used directly from anywhere, but `ReduxViewModel` should be the preferred entry point
- Manage local app state along with the global one, in `ViewModel` itself
- Includes `incognito` mode to keep the Store blind, to support pub/sub architecture
